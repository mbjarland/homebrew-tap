# Homebrew formula for findjar. Drop this file into a tap repo
# (typically mbjarland/homebrew-findjar) and users can install via:
#
#   brew install mbjarland/findjar/findjar
#
# Or, once published in homebrew-core, just:
#
#   brew install findjar
#
# After each tagged release, the URLs and sha256 digests below need to
# be bumped to point at the new release assets. The release workflow
# at .github/workflows/release.yml emits a SHASUMS256.txt file
# alongside the archives — copy from there.
